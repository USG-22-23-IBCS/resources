# IBCS Python Coding Quiz
# Name:

# Read the questions below carefully. Each question describes a
# method that you will need to define with code. In order to demonstrate
# that your method works and test your code, you will need to 'un-comment'
# the method call in the main() method


# 1. Given a list of integers, the method returns True if there are
# at least two numbers in the list that are the minimum value out of
# everything else in the list. If there is only one minimum,
# the method should return false.
def twoMin():
    return True


# 2. Given user input as a sentence, the method calculates the number
# of words and calculates the number of characters (excluding the spaces).
# The method then prints out the average word length.
def sentenceData():
    return True


def main():

    #print(twoMin([5, 2, 4, 8, 9, 5, 7, 2, 9, 3]))
    #print(twoMin([1, 8, 5, 8, 4, 7, 2, 9, 3]))
    #print(twoMin([1, 1, 1, 1]))

    sentenceData()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
