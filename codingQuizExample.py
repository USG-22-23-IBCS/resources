# IBCS Python Coding Quiz Practice #1
# Name:

# Read the questions below carefully. Each question describes a
# method that you will need to define with code. In order to demonstrate
# that your method works and test your code, you will need to 'un-comment'
# the method call in the main() method


# 1. Define a method which takes in one two integers, prints out
# which one is smaller and which one is larger. Also, it returns
# the sum of the numbers, the product of the two numbers, and the
# the quotient of the numbers where the larger number is the denominator.
def twoNumCalc():
    return True


# 2. Define a method which asks the user to input a first name. Then asks
# the user to input a last name. The method should create an email for
# them which starts with the first 3 letters of their first name and
# ends with the last 4 letters of their last name. The email address
# should include '@example.com' and should be returned
# Example: "Zack Considine" --> "zacdine@example.com"
def newEmail():
    return True


def main():

    #print(twoNumCalc(2, 5))
    #print(twoNumCalc(3, 8))
    #print(twoNumCalc(10, 4))

    print(newEmail())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
